<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>
Virtual Machine Set Up: 'üñ•Ô∏è

Step 1: Set Up Azure Virtual Machines and Network Security Groups 'üöÄ

'ü™êCreate Azure Virtual Machines:
Create at least two Azure Virtual Machines to simulate network traffic. Assign them appropriate configurations and operating systems.

 'ü™êVirutal Machine 1 (VM1) is Windows

 'ü™êVirtual Machine 2 (VM2) is Linux (Ubuntu)

'ü™êConfigure Network Security Groups (NSGs):
Create Network Security Groups and define inbound and outbound rules to control traffic to and from the VMs. For instance, you can allow or deny specific ports or protocols.

Step 2: Capture Network Traffic with Wireshark 'üöÄ

'ü™êInstall and Configure Wireshark on VMs:

'ü™êInstall Wireshark on the Azure VMs you created. Ensure that it's properly configured to capture network traffic on the desired network interfaces.

Step 3: Start a Capture: 'üöÄ
Launch Wireshark on the VM and start a packet capture on the network interface.

'ü™êGenerate Network Traffic:
Generate network traffic by accessing web pages, pinging other VMs, or using other applications that utilize the network.

Step 4: Stop the Capture:
Stop the packet capture in Wireshark after capturing sufficient traffic.

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

We are starting this demonstration as if the VMs and WireShark have already been installed. The main point of this is to display raw traffic between the VMs that have already been created in Azure. To start, paste IP address of VM1 into Remote Desktop credentials. And of course you will need to have the ip addresses for both of your VMs, you can easily get those by toggling back and forth from your Remote Desktop and your personal desktop.

Click on Ethernet (should turn blue)
Click on the sharkfin symbol in top left corner (capturing packets form Ethernet)

Hit Enter

You are now able to see live traffic that is happening in our virtual machine. Continuous traffic.

<p>
Type in icmp. This stops the spamming traffic. All the traffic is being filtered by icmp
Icmp is Internet control messaging protocol, which is the protocol that uses ping.

Voila! No traffic! 

Let‚Äôs go to PowerShell! 'üêö
Since we want to see traffic between VM1 and VM2, so we are going to ping it. We need the ip address for VM2 in order to ping it. So we are going back to our original desktop (go back to Azure) and copy the private ip address (10.2.0.5).

At command line: ping 10.2.0.5

Per below, 4 packets have been sent and 4 have been received. 
VM2 responded 4 times.

Okay for fun we are going to ping a public website. We will ping google.com in order to see more traffic in the protocol analyzer. 

At command line: ping www.google.com -4

We are sending traffic to google and google is replying. Below is a snapshot of the big picture check out the alphabet! LOL!

Initiate a perpetual/non-stop ping from VM1 to VM2.
Restart the capture data in Wireshark, click on the green shark fin to clear data. Click on Continue without saving data

This cleared the traffic

Go to powershell type in: ping 10.2.0.5 -t  
This will start a perpetual ping

Observe traffic

Observe traffic

Now we are going to stop the traffic (ping). 

Go back to Azure and open the Network Security Group for VM2 and disable incoming (inbound) ICMP traffic.
Make sure that you number the priority prior to any/other rules in group. 
This will stop traffic.

Go to settings and select: Inbound Security Rules. 
Click add, this will allow you to add the rule. We are going to select an * (which means any) for both Source Port Ranges & Destination Port Ranges.
Select Any for Source & Destination.
Select deny in order for the ping to stop. This will block the ICMP traffic.

Go to settings and select: Inbound Security Rules

Re-enable ICMP traffic for the Network Security Group your Ubuntu VM is using


Next we are going to filter for SSH Traffic. (SecureShell)





 Complete all of the required fields, which are designated with an asterik. This only includes the first screen under the basic tab. 
Continue to click through the tabs then create on the last tab. Virtual Machine should be validated and deployed.
